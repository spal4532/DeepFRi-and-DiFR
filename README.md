# DeepFRi-and-DiFR
This project contains required functions to create lists of auto-detected flux ropes and their geoeffectiveness directly from solar wind magnetic field data.
The main.ipynb shows an example of how to create lists of FRs and their geoeffectiveness. This accepts start and end time of solar wind duration under question.
The python files inside nrt_wind folder contain functions for pre-processing (`Pre_processing.py') solar wind data, DeepFRi (`DeepFRi.py') and DiFR (`DiFR.py') models and preparing autodotected FR lists -- `List 1', `List 2' and `Final list' (`Prepare_list.py'). 
For more details on the codes see the paper attached.
